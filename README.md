Box/housing built under the expert tutelage of [@BathCollege](https://twitter.com/bathcollege) woodworking instructor Paul Gilmore.

Code written using the really nice [Mozzi](http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi) by [@TimBarrass](https://twitter.com/timbarrass) running on a [Teensy 3.1](http://pjrc.com/teensy/) because it has real DAC instead of bit-banging PWM which is cool and all but not really quite as nice, right?

(This requires the (currently extremely-hard-to-find) [Teensyduino beta for Arduino 1.6](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/27740-Arduino-1-6-0-any-plans-to-support-it?p=66967&viewfull=1#post66967)— at least that's what I use to run it.)
